# Rock-Paper-Scissor-m1-Final

### Abstract:
This app allows users to play a classic and deluxe version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, or where I grew up, Roshambo. It seeks to provide users with a fun break from their day to quench their competitiveness. How many times can YOU beat the computer?

### Installation Instructions:
1. Fork this repository and clone down to local machine
1. Open project in text editor to view code
1. Click and drag HTML file to browser or enter command open index.html in your terminal to interact with the app.

### Preview of the App:

###Context:
This app prompt was given as the final project assignment for the first module at Turing--about 5 weeks into the program. This is a culmination of all that we learned in the first mod, with some of the content going beyond the breadth of the curriculum at Turing, requiring outside research and collaboration. Overall, the project took about 20 hours to reach its final iteration.

### Learning Goals:
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge.

### Wins and Challenges:
Wins and challenges go hand in hand for me. Whenever I come across a challenge, its a sign that I'm learning, so when I am able to overcome that challenge, and fully conceptualize something, it always feels like a big win. A few specific examples of this happening in this project:
- I was struggling to truly conceptualize how the order of my classes made a difference in how my app's behavior was executed. I started out with several global variables that semantically, should have been in the game class because they contained information on the current game. After working with my code for hours, it occured to me that in its current form, lots of those variables could be put into the game class to make the game class a more holistic illustration of the current game. This felt really good because I have been working on cleaning my code up, not just going with whatever was functional. I felt this was a good step in the right direction of understanding classes/the data model, how we can manipulate the data model prior to working through the DOM, and how cleaner code can make it easier to make the app more functional down the road.
